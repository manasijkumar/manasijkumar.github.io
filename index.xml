      <description>Mission StatementI am committed to inclusive mentoring and mentorship practices. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of mentoring trainees from diverse backgrounds. Recognizing that each mentee carries their unique life experiences, skill sets, and career aspirations, I ensure a personalized approach to mentorship. At the beginning of a mentoring relationship, my mentee and I draft a mentorship contract  , which explicitly outlines our shared goals and expectations.</description>

      <description>Mission StatementIn this age of easy access to misinformation, scientific literacy is essential for students to understand the world and to critically evaluate and validate any information they are presented with. My mission as an educator is to prepare students to be independent and critical thinkers, who are scientifically literate and able to apply their knowledge to their fields of interest.
To accomplish this, I create an inclusive and supportive learning environment by making expectations as explicit as possible, which allows students to push their boundaries and explore their interests.</description>

Summary of Course Evaluations
</h2>
</center>
<p>Course evaluations in the Department of Psychology at Columbia University use a 5-point scale. Students are asked to <strong>rate the overall teaching effectiveness of the instructor on a scale of 1 to 5</strong> (1 = Poor, 2 = Fair, 3 = Good, 4 = Very Good, 5 = Excellent). The table below summarizes my ratings for the different courses I’ve taught.</p>

<b>How-To’s of Research Comments</b>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>“Manasi was an amazing TA! I went to most of her office hours, and she really really helped me clarify all my problems with my research paper. She is very kind, supportive and understands all of the problems us students face. Overall, I really enjoyed being her student, and would definitely recommend her to other students!! I really appreciate all of her help :)”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Manasi was wonderful to learn from. Her assistance in office hours was really insightful, and she always gave detailed and constructive feedback on all of my assignments. My only possible
constructive critique is that sometimes she over-explains simple concepts, but it is only because she wants to make sure she doesn’t leave anyone behind–she put effort into making How To’s a space where all skill levels were welcome.”</p>
</blockquote>

<b>Research Methods Comments</b>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>“Manasi is the best TA I have had during my college career. She is incredibly timely in responding to emails and very clear in her answers to questions. She provides great feedback on our work and she creates a safe space to ask questions and think critically during class.“</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I cannot speak to any weakness, and YES, there is such thing as a perfect TA. Manasi has made a mark on me beyond Research Methods, and I am humbled by their kindness and humility. I appreciate that they are truly devoted to making sure I (and I’m sure other students as well) understand what we need to understand, and the care they show. Thank you, your dedication does not go unnoticed. It’s because of Manasi Research Methods is my favorite class to date at Columbia.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Manasi was an amazing TA, and genuinely one of most understanding and organized TAs that I have met so far. She is always there to help, open to any questions, and explains confusing concepts with clarity and helpful examples. I always feel comfortable reaching out to Manasi for help, and Manasi additionally provides great feedback, making lab a great experience!”</p>

<b>Statistics for Behavioral Scientists Comments</b>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>“Manasi did an incredible job leading the lab sections. She provided a review of the topics we had covered in class that week, which was super helpful.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“…Manasi was extremely helpful. In our labs, she took the time to answer every single question and broke down concepts in order for us to get a better grasp of them. I appreciated the review slides she would compile every week to maximize understanding of the material.”</p>

<p>“Manasi was a wonderful person and TA - she was always willing to help me in office hours and in class. Manasi gave me lots of effective feedback in regards to my predicted results within my presentation. I would highly recommend students work with Manasi in the future (because I definitely will!)”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Manasi was very on top of helping me with assignments that I had either turned in late or had a hard time understanding. My final project, particularly organization and methods, definitely benefitted through Manasi’s input.”</p>

<b>Testimonial from Student in Research Methods, Fall 2021</b>
</summary>
<p><em> As a senior set on graduating in May of 2022, my Research Methods class is the first class I have learned skills that will serve me beyond school. I started the class with fear and anxiety over “R-programming language” and only registered for the Research Methods class because I needed it to graduate.</p>
<p>Manasi, through her patience, compassion, and exceptional pedagogical skills, broke down the basic concepts of “R” to a point where a beginner like me understood coding in just two weeks. Her continued meticulousness helped me to learn to write academic papers. For our final research projects, I effortlessly navigated the “R” code-writing process with my group for data analysis.</p>
<p>Here at Columbia, I have had professors and TA’s who were the reason I dropped a class or changed my major. But Manasi’s kind-heartedness and dedication have further inspired me to pursue my interests in graduate-level research so that I can make learning interesting for the next generation of students as she has for me. Like my sixth-grade math teacher that broke down math for me to understand, for which reason I have loved math ever since, Manasi made me look forward to our classes and lab sessions every week.</p>
<p>She has made a mark on my Columbia experience, and I do not doubt other students feel the same about her teaching abilities. Her attentiveness and care in students’ comprehension are unmatched, and I believe people like her make learning fun and worthwhile. </em></p>

<b>Testimonial from Student in Research Methods, Fall 2021</b>
</summary>
<p><em> I just wanted to send you an email to thank you for all your help and support during this semester (and previous semester as well). This fall semester was very rough for me, I am still trying to peddle through it and there is no way that I would have gone through it without your help and support. Not just by providing incredibly useful feedback, and granting me an extension for the paper but also making me feel that it would be ok, that i have what it takes to make it work, and listened and appreciated. You are not just an incredible researcher, [Instructor], but also a[n incredible] person and I will always be forever thankful for your support. I hope when I see you next spring in the halls or in classrooms, you know that you have made a huge impact on me, and I will always be there if you ever need anything.</p>
<p>I just couldn’t express my gratitude more. Thank you for being there, in the times that I didnt believe in myself. Thank you for listening, and supporting me through the class. Thank you for caring and being you. </em></p>

<p>Hello! I’m Manasi Jayakumar.</p>
<p>I am a 4th year graduate student in the Department of Psychology at Columbia University, working with Dr. Mariam Aly. Broadly my research focus is on the interaction between attention and memory, and the neural mechanisms underlying these interactions. My current project examines the relationship between spontaneous attentional fluctuations and the temporal organization of memory.</p>
<p>I am originally from Chennai, India, but I grew up in Dubai, U.A.E.</p>

<h3>Prior education:</h3>
<p>I graduated with an undergraduate degree in Biotechnology Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology &amp; Science, Dubai, U.A.E. During my undergraduate career, I became interested in the field of cognitive neuroscience, particularly memory research. I then pursued a master’s degree in cognition and neuroscience, during which time I worked with Dr. Michael Rugg on a cross-sectional study examining neural differences in episodic memory encoding and retrieval between young, middle-aged and older adults. Upon graduating from my master’s degree, I worked with Dr. Anthony Wagner at Stanford University as a research coordinator and lab manager, on neural mechanisms of episodic memory in healthy aging and preclinical Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

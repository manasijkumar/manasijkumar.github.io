<h3>Teaching Development Program - Advanced Track</h3>
<p>In addition to the required pedagogy seminar in the department of psychology, I pursued and completed the advanced track of the Teaching Developement Program offered by the Center for Teaching and Learning. This involved actively engaging in 12 workshops, completing a multi-session intensive seminar, completing observations (both of myself, and other instructors), and creating a robust teaching portfolio.</p>

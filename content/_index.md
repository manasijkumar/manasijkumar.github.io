Broadly, I am interested in examining how internal mental states during an experience can influence memory organization and retrieval, and how these processes differ in individuals with attentional deficits. I use lab-based behavioral studies, eye-tracking, pupilometry, and computational modeling, in addition to online behavioral studies to explore these questions.

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate with Dr. Mariam Aly in the Department of Psychology at Columbia University examining the relationship between spontaneous attentional fluctuations and temporal organization of episodic memory.


### How did I get here? ### 

I am originally from Chennai, India, but I grew up in Dubai, U.A.E. 

I graduated with an undergraduate degree in Biotechnology Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Dubai, U.A.E. During my fourth year project, a chance encounter with  research on patient H.M. ignited my curiosity in cognitive neuroscience of memory. 

Switching careers to pursue memory research, I pursued a Master’s degree in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience at UT Dallas. During this time I worked with Dr. Michael Rugg on a cross-sectional study examining neural differences in episodic memory encoding and retrieval between young, middle-aged and older adults. 

After graduating from my master’s degree, I worked with Dr. Anthony Wagner at Stanford University as a research coordinator and lab manager. I worked on a large-scale multimodal project examining the neural mechanisms of episodic memory in healthy aging and preclinical Alzheimer’s disease.

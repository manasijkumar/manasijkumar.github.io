Mission Statement
</h2>
</center>
<p>In this age of easy access to misinformation, scientific literacy is essential for students to understand the world and to critically evaluate and validate any information they are presented with. <strong>My mission as an educator is to prepare students to be independent and critical thinkers, who are scientifically literate and able to apply their knowledge to their fields of interest.</strong></p>
<p>To accomplish this, I create an <strong>inclusive and supportive learning environment</strong> by making expectations as explicit as possible, which allows students to push their boundaries and explore their interests.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>as an attention and memory researcher, I integrate the science of learning with my teaching.</strong> I encourage students to take <strong>ownership of their progress and learn from their mistakes</strong> instead of viewing them as failures. I scaffold major assignments with smaller low-stakes sub-components that build on each other so students encouraging students to take ownership of their own progress, make mistakes, and learn from them.</p>
<p>When I teach programming, I encourage my mentees and students take ownership of the analysis and code it from start to finish. When they are faced with problems or bugs, I have them <strong>brainstorm and generate solutions instead of giving them the answer outright</strong>. This builds their confidence and improves their problem-solving abilities for the future.</p>

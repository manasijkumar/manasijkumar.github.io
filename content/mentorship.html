<b> Summer Internship in Psychological Sciences (SIPPS) </b>
</summary>
<p>SIPPS is a 10-week summer research internship program founded, organized, and conducted by Columbia University grad student volunteers. It provides an immersive and practical introduction to psychology and neuroscience research. The program is specifically designed for students with little to no prior experience. It comprises two main components: 1) 3 workshops a week that cover topics ranging from coding, professional development, research skills, and journal club. 2) a mentored research experience with a PhD student or postdoc mentor.</p>
<p>I have been a core member of the organizing team since 2021 involved in curriculum development, creating and leading workshops, organizing the program, and mentoring students. Below are examples of the SIPPS presentations by some of my mentees:</p>
<p>Nemeth, C.º, Jayakumar, M. (2022, August) How do attentional fluctuations affect the semantic organization of memory? Poster presented at the SIPPS 2022 Mini-Research Conference, New York, NY.</p>

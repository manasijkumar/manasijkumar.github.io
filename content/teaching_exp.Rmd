### Summer Internship Program in Psychological Sciences (SIPPS)

SIPPS is a 10-week summer internship program that formalizes training  for psychological research through a practical, hands-on, and immersive experience. The SIPPS curriculum consists of two components: 1) multiple weekly workshops on R programming, research skills, professional development, and/or journal club and 2) a mentored research experience where trainees are paired with postdoc and grad student mentors from the Psychology department. This is a completely volunteer-led and volunteer-run program.

Since 2021, I have been a core organizing team member for SIPPS. I have co-developed the workshop curriculum, co-managed the team of mentors, mentees, and workshop instructors, and co-organized a SIPPS research mini-conference at the end of each summer.

Below are some of the highlights of my pedagogical contribution over the past 3 summers:
